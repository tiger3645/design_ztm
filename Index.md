3. Visual Design
   Design theory, accesibility, typography, UI elements, color, imagery & iconography.
4. Design Exploration
   Design patterns, mobile design, applying visual design, motion, micro-interactions. Best practices for making the user interact with our product in a way that creates a great user experience.
5. Putting it together
