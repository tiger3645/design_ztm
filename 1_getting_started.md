# Getting Started

The first phase of building any product is planning. This is probably the most important phase, since it's where we decide and map the entire project: how should it look and feel, and what should it do.
This is also when we are interacting with the client, and deciding what their goals are.

## Sketching

Sketching is a two-step process. The first one is idea generation, here we want to approach a product and generate as many ideas as we can. It´s just about getting ideas out there, without many details. The next step is adding detail and refining. It´s OK to kill some ideas here, we just keep on polishing the ideas we find best suitable for the project in hand.

### Generating Ideas

These are the first sketches we make. The goal is to generate a lot of options without many details.

First there are ideas. Generally these are black and white drawings, without much detail. Then there are wireframes, which start adding fine details to the ideas and start thinking about user interaction. The next step is components. These are needed components, such as buttons, inputs, different types of contents we'll be needing.

### Starting the sketching process

The first step for sketching is being prepared. We need to have tools beforehand, like pencils, paper, even a tablet. Then we are going to think about what our goals are. What are we trying to solve here? We are also going to think about our audience. If we're the ones who are deciding on how to move on, then it's fine if we are a bit messy. But if we are communicating our ideas to someone else- maybe a client or even a coworker, we need to be clean them up a bit so we don't waste our or their time.

A good advide is to time-box ourselves. That is, limiting the time we spend on each step of the process so we move on faster and don's dwelve too much on bad ideas.

Step two is simply start sketching. Drawing a frame for our project (a phone, a desktop, etc.) helps us guide our sketch. Then we need to think about what elements we are going to reuse a lot, like a header, an action button, a user message. From there, we move on to more detailed elements and interactions. This doesn't need to be fully polished, we just need to use a few shapes like circles and rectangles to get the idea of specific interactions we are going to be using in our project.

It's vital we annotate and document our sketches. The worst thing is looking back and not understand what we've sketched before. After all that, we must keep going. Find the sketches we like and create alternatives, sharing them, asking for opinions. Showing someone else what your idea is and explaining them what your goals are always helps brew better design.

The last step is refining. We want to clean our sketches up. Here we have to start by adding titles to all our sketches, this helps us identify which screens are relevant without thinking too much about it. Here annotations become enourmously useful, as they provide context onto a sketch. They also help clarify things that are hard to draw.
We can also number the sketches, as it makes us putting them in an order, and keeping things organized.

Arrows are a great idea! They easily help to indicate a transition.

Another good idea is adding gestures, as most new devices have touchscreen capabilities.

### Sketching User Flows

To sketch user flows we have to understand what we need to draw. This is figuring out exactly what we're thinking of sketching (is it a long journey or a small interaction?).

Then we have to define a starting point, whether it's at the start, or at the end, or even in some middle point. We have to find what's bes suited for us.

After that, we need to go where to go from here. We need to ask ourselves important questions such as which way this step will lead our users, where do we want them to go, and what does the user need to do to get there.

We must think about all the different ways a person can go about a certain route. What options do they have? What happens if the user closes the app at this point? Where will they resume?

It's very important to take into consideration how we want our users to feel when going through a flow against how they are probably going to feel when they reach certain steps. For example, when searching for a product in a list maybe they are not going to find what they're looking for. Here we should try and improve their experience by helping them, making the flow more understandable.

#### Navigation Schemes

Navigation schemes can help us figure out which options our users can choose, as well as the directions they can move in various pars of our product. It helps to define our navigation and the hierarchies within.

Basically, this is the structure of our product. We want to build a minimum viable product, the features users want right away. More content can be added later, but the essential has to be there to start.

#### Screen States

We need to start thinking about what happens when users start interacting with the app. For example, what happens if the user starts typing in a search box. Maybe we show a few autocomplete options.

Adding motion and micro-interactions early on these sketches can help with feedback and understanding the state of a screen.

### Tips

1. Be messy.
   Don't worry about details, just jump right in and start sketching a general idea of the app. The sooner we start asking ourselves questions about why we would go a certain way, the sooner we start refining the idea. All we need is some squares, some rectangles, maybe circles, and a few annotations to get a clear idea of how our app would look.
2. Keep the sketches safe
   If we are using paper, take a picture. Keep your sketches in a folder. Scan them and save them. If we are sketching digitally, have a backup. Losing a sketch can mean losing a great idea.
3. Always be prepared
   You never know when an idea is gonna come, so always have a sketchbook and pencil near in order to quickly sketch out that next great app.
4. Hang up your sketches
   Having your sketches visible can serve both as inspiration as well as to quickly jump in and continue working on them.
5. Communicate
   Every product starts from something. Sharing them with other people can always provide good insight into what can be done and how it could be improved upon.
6. Make a simple animation in figma
   Sometimes it's hard to get a feeling about a product when it's static, whether it's on paper or digital. A good way to quickly get a hang of how well it would work is to export this sketches into figma and make a simple animation for us to try. Without many details we can already start figuring if something we added really fits the overall idea.

## Inspiration

How to stay inspired? Maybe sometimes we start really well but get lost in the middle of the project.

Creativity is like a muscle, if we don't train it we might lose it. But there's more than one way to keep it trained. Here's a few ways todo so:

1. Talk to your peers
   Talking to our peers can have a huge impact on our creativity. Tapping into their brains is a great way to get inspiration. Bounce ideas off of them and talk about your projects!
2. Study others
   It's important to study others' work and understanding what their solutions are about. Dissecting their work and how they solved design problems they had is an excellent excercise.
   Collect examples of others and learn from them.
3. Surround yourself with great design
   It could even be digitally, but keeping inspiration around us allows us to pull from whatever we need to. Sites like Dribble or Unsplash, a nice looking desk, or even a cool plant serves as a great reminder of what we are trying to achieve.
4. Stay educated on a variety of topics
   Educating one self is essential to grow as a designer and as a person. We should always want to learn more about everything.
5. Design for yourself
   Always designing for someone else can be draining. Taking time to freely express one's creativity can help reload that inspiration we once had.
6. Travel and explore the world
   Traveling exposes us to new culture. It opens our eyes to new possibilities and takes us out of our confort zone. It really pushes us forward.
7. Walk
   Take a walk. Away from your desk. Leave the office, take a deep breath, chat with coworkers, get a coffee. This boosts your creativity by a lot (and it's scientifically proven!)

### How to find inspiration

A key to the designing process is to have constant source of online inspiration. There are several sites to do so:

1. Dribble (dribble.com)
   Animation, branding, drawing, etc. A lot of stuff to find inspiration.
2. Pinterest (pinterest.com)
   A lot of noise, but a lot to choose from.
3. Behance (behance.net)
   A lot of great ideas and creativity, as well as some job opportunities.
4. Pttrns (pttrns.com)
   Paid, but really good for components.
5. Awwwards (awwwards.com)
   Award-winning websites.
