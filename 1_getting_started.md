# Getting Started

The first phase of building any product is planning. This is probably the most important phase, since it's where we decide and map the entire project: how should it look and feel, and what should it do.
This is also when we are interacting with the client, and deciding what their goals are.

## Sketching

Sketching is a two-step process. The first one is idea generation, here we want to approach a product and generate as many ideas as we can. It´s just about getting ideas out there, without many details. The next step is adding detail and refining. It´s OK to kill some ideas here, we just keep on polishing the ideas we find best suitable for the project in hand.

### Generating Ideas

These are the first sketches we make. The goal is to generate a lot of options without many details.

First there are ideas. Generally these are black and white drawings, without much detail. Then there are wireframes, which start adding fine details to the ideas and start thinking about user interaction. The next step is components. These are needed components, such as buttons, inputs, different types of contents we'll be needing.

### Starting the sketching process

The first step for sketching is being prepared. We need to have tools beforehand, like pencils, paper, even a tablet. Then we are going to think about what our goals are. What are we trying to solve here? We are also going to think about our audience. If we're the ones who are deciding on how to move on, then it's fine if we are a bit messy. But if we are communicating our ideas to someone else- maybe a client or even a coworker, we need to be clean them up a bit so we don't waste our or their time.

A good advide is to time-box ourselves. That is, limiting the time we spend on each step of the process so we move on faster and don's dwelve too much on bad ideas.

Step two is simply start sketching. Drawing a frame for our project (a phone, a desktop, etc.) helps us guide our sketch. Then we need to think about what elements we are going to reuse a lot, like a header, an action button, a user message. From there, we move on to more detailed elements and interactions. This doesn't need to be fully polished, we just need to use a few shapes like circles and rectangles to get the idea of specific interactions we are going to be using in our project.

It's vital we annotate and document our sketches. The worst thing is looking back and not understand what we've sketched before. After all that, we must keep going. Find the sketches we like and create alternatives, sharing them, asking for opinions. Showing someone else what your idea is and explaining them what your goals are always helps brew better design.

The last step is refining. We want to clean our sketches up. Here we have to start by adding titles to all our sketches, this helps us identify which screens are relevant without thinking too much about it. Here annotations become enourmously useful, as they provide context onto a sketch. They also help clarify things that are hard to draw.
We can also number the sketches, as it makes us putting them in an order, and keeping things organized.

Arrows are a great idea! They easily help to indicate a transition.

Another good idea is adding gestures, as most new devices have touchscreen capabilities.
